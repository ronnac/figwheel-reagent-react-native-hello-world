Template to create a ClojureScript Reagent-React-Native Project for use with figwheel.main and expo.
Based on the [blog post of Luca Cambiaghi](https://www.lucacambiaghi.com/posts/react-native-cljs.html).


I use this learn to create mobile apps on Android/termux.  
Note: shadow-cljs is too resource heavy for use on my mobile phone, therefore I opted for figwheel.main.  
In termux I use doom emacs as code editor, because it starts up faster than spacemacs.
Recently the termux team has added openjdk17 to their repository, so installing clojure is now straightforward.
